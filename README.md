# Few-shot Learning + Interpolation for Classification in Low-resource Dialogue Systems

In this project, we implement a novel training framework to eliminate class-imabalance issues in low-resource dialogue system like the Virtual Patient project. We combine the contrastive loss \[\] with a 1-nearest-neighbor search to improve generalization for rare classes. Additionally, we combine it with a "mixup" \[\] based KL divergence loss as a data-augmentation technique which also helps maintain performance on frequent classes.
